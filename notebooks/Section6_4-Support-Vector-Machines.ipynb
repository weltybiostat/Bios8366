    "One robust alternative to addressing missing data is **multiple imputation** (Schaffer 1999, van Buuren 2012). It produces unbiased parameter estimates, while simultaneously accounting for the uncertainty associated with imputing missing values. It is conceptually and mechanistically straightforward, and produces complete datasets that may be analyzed using any statistical methodology or software one chooses, as if the data had no missing values to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple imputation generates imputed values based on a **regression model**. This regression model will help us generate reasonable values, particularly if data are MAR, since it uses information in the dataset that may be informative in predicting what the true value may be. Ideally, we want predictor variables that are **correlated** with the missing variable, and with the mechanism of missingness, if any. For example, one might be able to use test scores from one subject to predict missing test scores from another; or, the probability of income reporting to be missing may vary systematically according to the education level of the individual."
