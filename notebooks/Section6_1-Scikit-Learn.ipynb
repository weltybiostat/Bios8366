    "# Introduction to `Scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scikit-learn` package is an open-source library that provides a robust set of machine learning algorithms for Python. It is built upon the core Python scientific stack (*i.e.* NumPy, SciPy, Cython), and has a simple, consistent API, making it useful for a wide range of statistical learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ME24ePzpzIM/UQLWTwurfXI/AAAAAAAAANw/W3EETIroA80/s1600/drop_shadows_background.png\" width=\"800px\"/>\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is about coding programs that automatically adjust their performance from exposure to information encoded in data. This learning is achieved via **tunable parameters** that are automatically adjusted according to performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning can be considered a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major classes of ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms which learn from a training set of *labeled* examples (exemplars) to generalize to the set of all possible inputs. Examples of supervised learning include regression and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms which learn from a training set of *unlableled* examples, using the features of the inputs to categorize inputs together according to some statistical criteria. Examples of unsupervised learning include k-means clustering and kernel density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms that learn via reinforcement from a *critic* that provides information on the quality of a solution, but not on how to improve it. Improved solutions are achieved by iteratively exploring the solution space. We will not cover RL in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Data in `scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms implemented in scikit-learn expect data to be stored in a\n",
    "**two-dimensional array or matrix**.  The arrays can be\n",
    "either ``numpy`` arrays, or in some cases ``scipy.sparse`` matrices.\n",
    "The size of the array is expected to be `[n_samples, n_features]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n_samples:**   The number of samples: each sample is an item to process (e.g. classify).\n",
    "  A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, an astronomical object,\n",
    "  a row in database or CSV file,\n",
    "  or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.\n",
    "- **n_features:**  The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each\n",
    "  item in a quantitative manner.  Features are generally real-valued, but may be boolean or\n",
    "  discrete-valued in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features must be fixed in advance. However it can be very high dimensional\n",
    "(e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. This is a case\n",
    "where `scipy.sparse` matrices can be useful, in that they are\n",
    "much more memory-efficient than numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Iris morphometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the datasets included with `scikit-learn` is a set of measurements for flowers, each being a member of one of three species: *Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolor* or *Iris Virginica*. \n",

Though we have 4 variables to work with, it appears that there is redundant information among them, so we might try to reduce the dimension of the problem, deriving a smaller number of latent variables that describe most of the overall variation in the dataset. For example, we might want 2 variables so that we can visualize differences among the species graphically.\n",

    "PCA is a transformation for identifying a set of latent variables corresponding to orthogonal components of variation. It locates a vector that describes an axis of largest variation in the hyperspace of the original variables.

It then identifies a third such orthogonal vector, and so on, up to the number of original variables in the dataset.\n",

    "To demonstrate how `scikit-learn` is used, let's conduct a logistic regression analysis on a dataset for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data on 671 infants with very low (less than 1600 grams) birth weight from 1981-87 were collected at Duke University Medical Center by [OShea *et al.* (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1635885). Of interest is the relationship between the outcome intra-ventricular hemorrhage and the predictors birth weight, gestational age, presence of pneumothorax, mode of delivery, single vs. multiple birth, and whether the birth occurred at Duke or at another hospital with later transfer to Duke. A secular trend in the outcome is also of interest.\n",
